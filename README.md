# MathChemPuzzle
A puzzle created for Caltech's Ditch Day.

In this puzzle a variety of mathematical statements are written in an "alien language" and presented without context.
The goal is to use them to identify a four-digit code to undo a padlock.

The 'Stretch' file includes an extra challenge, which you can check using the 'Checksum' file. The 'just math' version of page 35 is for a simpler version of the puzzle. The '5\_old' file is just presented for reference.
